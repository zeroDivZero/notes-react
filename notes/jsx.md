# JSX

Syntax extension for JavaScript to allow describing UI in HTML-like syntax. Syntax sugar. Ex: `<div />` is transformed at build time to `React.createElement('div')`.

Can put any JS expression within braces inside JSX. Each React element is JS object that can be stored in variable or pass around.

## 3 Rules

1. Return single root element.
2. Close all tags.
3. camelCase most things.
